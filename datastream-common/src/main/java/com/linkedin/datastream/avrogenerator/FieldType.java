/**
 * FieldType is an interface to the wrapper classes for different Database Types.
 *
 * there are 3 main types of data you can store:
 *
 * 1. Simple Primitive types
 *    These are the CHARS, VARCHAR2, TIMESTAMP etc.
 *
 * 2. Struct Types
 *    Struct Types are better viewed as table with in a table. In some cases developers might
 *    want to build their own type and store it in Oracle. For example you might have a column
 *    with name: Settings, that stores a type: SETTING, (instead of the primitive CHARS or NCHARS).
 *    Now this type SETTING can be modeled with child types that are primitive or might be other
 *    Struct Types.
 *
 * 3. Array/Collection Types
 *    This is when developers choose to store an associative array within a single column.
 *    For example, you might have a column with name: PhoneNumbers, that stores a type: ARRAY.
 *    Each element in the Array might be type CHAR. The elements of this array can be of
 *    any type [CHARS (primitive), SETTING (struct), or more ARRAY's (array), .. etc]
 *    Note, that Oracle collections adhere to strict types, meaning a collection can only
 *    only one subtype.
