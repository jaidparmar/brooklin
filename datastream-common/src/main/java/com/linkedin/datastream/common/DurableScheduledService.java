/**
 * This class implements a Guava-based service which runs a task periodically. This class has special durable properties
 * which make it difficult for exceptions, errors, or non-terminating code within a task to prevent future executions.
 *
 * To use this service, implement the {@link #startUp()}, {@link #shutDown()}, and {@link #runOneIteration()} methods.
 * Then, start it with {@link #startAsync()}, and stop it with {@link #stopAsync()}. For other supported APIs, see
 * {@link Service}.
 *
 * Because of its durable nature, it may be possible for the class responsible for this service to encounter errors
 * which this class is unaffected by. This may cause this service to leak. Override the {@link #hasLeaked()} method as
 * described in the comments to provide some mitigation in case this happens.
 *
 * If you suspect that the running task may get permanently stuck (block indefinitely), you can implement
 * {@link #signalShutdown(Thread)} to give this service a way to signalShutdown the running task to exit.
